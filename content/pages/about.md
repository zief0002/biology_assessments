Quantitative Biology Education Assessment Resources (QBEAR) is a repository of assessment instruments that exist for measuring the quantitative ability and reasoning of biology students.

### People

QBEAR was created by the following people:

**Kristine Grayson** is an [Assistant Professor of Biology at University of Richmond](https://biology.richmond.edu/faculty/kgrayson/). In addition to her [research on amphibian conservation and invasion of forest pests](https://blog.richmond.edu/graysonlab/), her interests include the [use and accessibility of data-centric teaching resources](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/data_incubator). At her institution, she has contributed to redesigning the core curriculum to align with recommendations from [Vision and Change](https://visionandchange.org/) and assessing outcomes for student learning using several national instruments. Kristine is also an HHMI BioInteractive Ambassador and Faculty Mentoring Network facilitator with the [Quantitative Undergraduate Biology Education and Synthesis project](https://qubeshub.org/).




**Erik Larson** is a [Professor of Sociology](https://www.macalester.edu/sociology/facultystaff/eriklarson/) at Macalester College. Building on his multimethod research, he has more than a decade of experience in working on a variety of assessment activities linked with curricular change at both institutional and multi-institutional levels. His contributions include research design, data analysis, reporting, and developing strategies to implement findings of assessment activities. 

**Paul Overvoorde** is [Professor of Biology](https://www.macalester.edu/biochemistry/facultystaff/paulovervoorde/) and [Vice Provost and Associate Dean of the Faculty](https://www.macalester.edu/provost/staff/paulovervoorde/) at Macalester College.  He is a member of the consortium that developed the [Biological Science Quantitative Reasoning Exam](https://www.macalester.edu/hhmi/biosquare/) and he participated in the [Genomics Education Partnership (GEP)](https://gep.wustl.edu/). In his current role, he oversees departmental and institutional assessment activities. He has served as Program Director for an HHMI Undergraduate Science Education Grant to Macalester College.

**Liz Stanhope** is an [Associate Professor of Mathematics](https://college.lclark.edu/live/profiles/67-liz-stanhope) at Lewis &amp; Clark College. She is a member of the consortium that developed the [Biological Science Quantitative Reasoning Exam](https://www.macalester.edu/hhmi/biosquare/). In addition to work as a DBER, she has published work in differential geometry and combinatorics.  She is a member of PKAL and an R.L. Moore Project NExT Fellow. She has served as Program Director for an HHMI Undergraduate Science Education Grant.  

**Andrew Zieffler** is a Senior Lecturer and researcher in the [Quantitative Methods in Education](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/programs/qme/) program within the [Department of Educational Psychology](https://www.cehd.umn.edu/edpsych/programs/qme/) at the University of Minnesota. He is a member of the consortium that developed the [Biological Science Quantitative Reasoning Exam](https://www.macalester.edu/hhmi/biosquare/). He has authored/co-authored several papers and book chapters related to statistics education, and has been a co-PI on many NSF-funded statistics education research projects.
