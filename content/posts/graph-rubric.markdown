### Key Concepts Targeted in the Assessment

The Graph Rubric is an evidence-based, analytic rubric that can be used to evaluate students' graph choice and construction. The rubric focuses on graph mechanics, graph communication, and graph choice and can provide information about whether these concepts are (1) Present and appropriate; (2) Need improvement; or (3) Unsatisfactory.


<br />

### Validity Evidence

Validity evidence collected included developing the rubric based on relevant literature. The rubric was revised based on trying it in the "wild" and examining data from data collected during interviews of undergraduate and graduate students. Four research-active biology instructors from diverse biology subdisciplines also reviewed the rubric. 


Psychometric evidence included inter-rater reliability based on the evaluation of several instructor- and student-generated graphs from selected chapters from five introductory biology textbooks.

### Appropriate Uses/Inferences
 
Evaluation using the Graph Rubric could be used to inform the teaching and evaluation of data summary graphs and to provide undergraduate students with formative and summative feedback on their graphs.
