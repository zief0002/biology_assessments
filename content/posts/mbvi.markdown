The Math–Biology Values Instrument (MBVI) measures the interest, utility, and perceived cost that undergraduate life science majors place on using math in the context of biology. 

<br />

## Assessment Information

- **Website:** None
- **Number of Items:** 11
- **Item Format:** Selected-response
- **Time (Estimated):** 10 minutes
- **Mode of Administration:** DIY (Copy/paste the items listed in the publication)

<br />

### Key Concepts Targeted in the Assessment

The MBVI measures the value biology students place on math using three subscales: (1) interest&mdash;the enjoyment of using math to understand, (2) utility&mdash;the usefulness of math of life science, (3) perceived cost&mdash; the negative aspects of using math.

<br />

### Validity Evidence

Validity evidence collected included an assessment blueprint mapping based on the Math Values Inventory, excluding the "attainment"" dimention (the part of identity that comes from math since it is not seen as part of students' likely identity in the context of biology).

Expert review of construct, cognitive interviews of students, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, convergent (with math ask values) and discriminant (with social desirability) validity 



 This content was further reviewed by six experts in the field of quantitative biology and one expert in assessment. Think-aloud interviews were also carried out with 20 undergraduate Life Science majors.


The psychometric analysis (exploratory factor analysis) used data from 207 students enrolled in introductory biology and upper-level biology courses at four institutions (two research universities, one comprehensive university, and one primarily undergraduate institution) and one community college system in the United States. Three of these institutions were in the Northeast, one was in the Southwest, and one was in the South Central region. 

Because of the limited ability to generalize from initial study to underrepresented minorities, the authors also carried out a second study including students from 19 institutions and composed of 1,026 students. The proimary analysis reported from this study was a confirmatory factor analysis.

### Appropriate Uses/Inferences
 
MBVI scores are most useful for drawing inferences about course content rather than to make student-level decisions or inferences.

### FAQs
 
**Can the assessment be customized to my specific course content?** 
Yes, since you copy-and-paste the items from the article.

** What information is reported back to me?: 
None, as the instructor is responsible for administering and scoring the assessment.

**How do I get access to the assessment?**
The assessment is available in the Supplementary Materials of the [CBE-LSE article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5589425/)
