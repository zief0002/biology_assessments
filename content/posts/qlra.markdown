### Key Concepts Targeted in the Assessment

The key concpets targeted by the QLRA are students' quantitative Literacy and reasoning, defined as the skill set necessary to process quantitative information and the capacity to critique, reflect upon, and apply quantitative information in making decisions.


<br />

### Validity Evidence

The QLRA was developed by a team of QL experts and was based on items synthesized from existing QL placement tests from Bowdoin, Colby-Sawyer, and Wellesley. In addition items were drawn from Dartmouth  Collegeâ€™s *Math Attitudes Survey* and [Fagerlins et al.'s (2017)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0272989X07304449) Subjective Numeracy Scale. In spring 2012, the 23-item QLRA was piloted with 1,659 students from 10 different institutions, including community colleges, small liberal arts colleges, and large public universities. 

Based on the pilot data, the QLRA was revised to 20 items and administered in spring of 2013 to 2,173 students from 11 different institutions, including community colleges, small liberal arts colleges, and large public universities. Psychometric analyses included factor and item analyses to assess the dimensionality of the construct, internal consistency of the scores and inter-item reliability.

### Appropriate Uses/Inferences

The QLRA can be utilized to provide data for student advising and placement in courses.
