#### Purpose

The Biological Science Quantitative Reasoning Exam (BioSQuaRE) assesses core quantitative skills identified in national reports (e.g.,*Bio2010*, *Vision &amp; Change*, *Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians*, *AP Bio Skills*, *Next Generation Science Standards*) that students should possess after they have completed an introductory biology sequence. Key concepts targeted include: (1) Algebra, functions, and modeling; (2) Statistics and probability; and (3) Visualization.

#### Population/Uses

BioSQuaRE scores are most useful for determining the quantitative ability level of undergraduate biology students (as a cohort) as they progress through the biology curriculum. This information can be utilized to inform curricular change and design.
