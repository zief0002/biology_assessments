The Biological Science Quantitative Reasoning Exam (BioSQuaRE) assesses core quantitative skills identified in national reports (e.g.,*Bio2010*, *Vision &amp; Change*, *Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians*, *AP Bio Skills*, *Next Generation Science Standards*) that students should possess after they have completed an introductory biology sequence

<br />

## Assessment Information

- **Website:** https://www.macalester.edu/hhmi/biosquare/
- **Number of Items:** 29
- **Item Format:** Selected-response
- **Time (Estimated):** 30&ndash;40 minutes
- **Mode of Administration:** Online (via Qualtrics)

<br />

### Key Concepts Targeted in the Assessment

There are three general content strands targeted within BioSQuaRE: (1) Algebra, functions, and modeling; (2) Statistics and probability; and (3) Visualization. 

Nine of the items on BioSQuaRE have content related to algebra, functions, and modeling. These include content about students':

- Ability to carry out mathematical computations (e.g. predicted values from a model),
- Understanding and interpretation of data/relationships expressed in tables, 
- Understanding of recursive functions and relationships, and
- Understanding of logarithmic/exponential relationships.

Eight of the items on BioSQuaRE have content related to statistics and probability. These include content about students':

- Understanding the role of variation in biological systems,
- Understanding and interpretation of descriptive summaries of data, and
- Understanding and interpretations of information related to statistical inference.

Twelve of the items on BioSQuaRE have content related to visualization. These include content about students':

- Interpretations of multivariate data presented in a graph (e.g., interactions),
- Spatial reasoning (e.g., geographic information), and
- Recognition of appropriate data visualization formats.

### Validity Evidence

Validity evidence collected included an assessment blueprint mapping content recommended by *Bio2010*, *Vision &amp; Change*, *Scientific Foundations for Future Physicians*, *AP Bio Skills*, *Next Generation Science Standards*. This content was further reviewed by 38 faculty members from five liberal arts colleges.


The psychometric analysis (item response theory; Rasch model) used data from 555 students from five different postsecondary institutions across the United States. These institutions included two Hispanic-serving institutions, an M1 master’s university, an R1 doctoral university, and a private liberal arts college. Of the sample, 64% reported being female, and 35% reported being first-generation college students. In addition, 42% of students indicated that they identify as white, 17% as Asian, 23% as Hispanic, 3% as Black, and 10% as some other race or as multiracial. These numbers mirror those obtained through data collected in 2015 by the [National Center for Education Statistics (Table 322.30)](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d15/ tables/dt15_322.30.asp). The students in the sample reported completing a range of biology courses at the postsecondary level; 21% reported that they had completed one or fewer biology courses, 32% reported having completed two or three, and 43% reported having completed four or more.

### Appropriate Uses/Inferences
 
BioSQuaRE scores are most useful for determining the quantitative ability level of students (as a cohort) as they progress through the biology curriculum. This information can be utilized to inform curricular change and design.
