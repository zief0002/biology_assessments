The Statistical Reasoning in Biology Concept Inventory (SRBCI) measures students' statistical reasoningin biology.




<br />

## Assessment Information

- **Website:** 
- **Number of Items:** 12
- **Item Format:** Selected-response
- **Time (Estimated):** 17 minutes
- **Mode of Administration:** Powerpoint slides and scantron for responses

<br />

### Key Concepts Targeted in the Assessment

The four core conceptual groupings assessed by SRBCI are: (1) Repeatability of results; (2) Variation in data; (3) Hypotheses and predictions; and (4) Sample size. 



<br />

### Validity Evidence

Validity evidence collected included developing the assessment by studying common errors and misconceptions from student exams and assignments. Think-aloud interviews with 23 undergraduate students were conducted and the modified items were further reviewed by 17 expert faculty members.


The psychometric analysis (item response theory; Rasch model) used data from two populations of students at a large research institution in Canada. One analysis was carried out on responses from 371 first-year biology students, and a second analysis was performed on the responses from 86 third-year biology students.

### Appropriate Uses/Inferences
 
BioSQuaRE scores are most useful for determining the quantitative ability level of students (as a cohort) as they progress through the biology curriculum. This information can be utilized to inform curricular change and design.
