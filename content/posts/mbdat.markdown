The Data Analysis Skills in Molecular Biology (MBDAT) assesses undergraduate biology major students ability to analyze and interpret experimental data, to elucidate misinterpretations of data, and to measure studentsâ€™ self-perceived confidence in their data-analysis skills. 

<br />

## Assessment Information

- **Website:** None
- **Number of Items:** 20
- **Item Format:** Selected-response
- **Time (Estimated):** 20 minutes
- **Mode of Administration:** Paper

<br />

### Key Concepts Targeted in the Assessment

The MBDAT targets the following key concepts: (1) critical viewing, (2) visual reasoning, (3) constructing meaning, and (4) knowledge of visual conventions.

<br />

### Validity Evidence

Validity evidence collected included an assessment blueprint mapping using the [Visual Literacy Index](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23796529.2007.11674644?needAccess=true#aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGFuZGZvbmxpbmUuY29tL2RvaS9wZGYvMTAuMTA4MC8yMzc5NjUyOS4yMDA3LjExNjc0NjQ0P25lZWRBY2Nlc3M9dHJ1ZUBAQDA=). This content was further reviewed by 8 expert faculty members. Think-aloud interviews were also carried out with 32 undergraduate Biology major students.


The psychometric analysis (classical test theory) used data from 127 upper-level (majors in science or health sciences at the junior and senior level and completed prerequisite courses that included content in cell biology, molecular biology, and genetics) and 73 introductory-level biology students to examine
item difficulty, item discrimination index, and score reliability. The study participants included students from a large public research extensive university, a minority-serving institution, and a public, primarily undergraduate university.

### Appropriate Uses/Inferences
 
MBDAT scores are most useful for drawing inferences about individual students' ability to analyze and interpret experimental data, to elucidate misinterpretations of data, and to measure their self-perceived confidence in their data-analysis skills.
