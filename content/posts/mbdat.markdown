#### Purpose

The Data Analysis Skills in Molecular Biology (MBDAT) assesses undergraduate biology major students ability to analyze and interpret experimental data, to elucidate misinterpretations of data, and to measure students' self-perceived confidence in their data-analysis skills. The MBDAT targets the following key concepts: (1) critical viewing, (2) visual reasoning, (3) constructing meaning, and (4) knowledge of visual conventions.

#### Population/Uses

MBDAT scores are most useful for drawing inferences about individual students' ability to analyze and interpret experimental data, to elucidate misinterpretations of data, and to measure their self-perceived confidence in their data-analysis skills. The ideal population for the instrument is upper-division biology students.
